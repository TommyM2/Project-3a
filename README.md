# Stock Data Visualizer

A web application built using **Flask** that allows users to view stock data over different time periods. Users can select a stock symbol, choose the time series (daily, weekly, or monthly), and generate a line or bar chart displaying the stock's closing price over the specified range of dates.

### Features

- **Stock Symbol Input**: Users can input a stock symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple).
- **Time Series Selection**: Users can choose between daily, weekly, or monthly time series.
- **Chart Type**: The app generates either a line chart or bar chart.
- **Date Range Selection**: Users can define a start date and end date for the data to be visualized.
- **Dynamic Chart Generation**: Charts are generated based on the user's input and displayed directly on the webpage.

### Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Web framework for Python.
- **Alpha Vantage API**: Provides real-time and historical data for stocks.
- **Pygal**: A Python library for generating SVG charts.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic web technologies for creating the user interface.
